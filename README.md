TODO:
1. Web template
create a side bar to hold components with styles
it should expand to show different types available for a give component type or have a header

2. drag and drop components feature using the template array

3. Save Template

4. Export template as html



Features to be done:
* Show list of components for each section 
* Drag and drop or select and insert component in the array
* edit image and store temporarily to export web page
* show code preview



Issues:
1. export without draggable
    write a function that grabs the array's current value and return JSX;
    which will be passed to the existing function
